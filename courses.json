This course equips you with essential knowledge of industry-recognized cyber security standards and frameworks to help protect your organization's assets, operations, and reputation.   \n\nOver ten comprehensive modules, you'll gain practical insights into risk management strategies, information security systems, and effective security controls. Whether you're new to cyber security or looking to enhance your existing skills, this course provides a solid foundation for navigating the complex world of digital protection.\n\nWe start by exploring the fundamental purpose of cyber security standards. You'll learn why aligning your organization's practices with industry benchmarks is crucial for maintaining a strong security posture. We'll dive into risk management frameworks like NIST RMF and ISO 31000, teaching you how to identify, assess, and mitigate risks to your critical assets.\n\nNext, we'll focus on Information Security Management Systems (ISMS), with special attention to the globally recognized ISO 27001/27002 standards. You'll discover how to establish robust ISMS processes, implement key security controls, and foster a culture of continuous improvement within your organization.\n\nThe course then expands into widely adopted cyber security frameworks such as NIST CSF, NIST SP 800-53, and CIS Critical Security Controls. These powerful tools offer structured approaches to identifying and addressing cyber risks, allowing you to tailor security controls to your organization's specific needs.\n\nWe'll also explore specialized security domains, including:\n\n- Identity and access management\n- Data protection and privacy\n- Network and application security\n- Security operations and incident response\n\nYou'll gain practical knowledge in areas like authentication, authorization, encryption, data privacy compliance, network segmentation, web application security, secure coding practices, and incident response planning.\n\nRecognizing the unique challenges faced by critical infrastructure and regulated industries, we dedicate a module to sector-specific security standards. This includes guidelines from NERC CIP, SOCI, AESCSF, FISMA, HIPAA, ASD Essential 8, ASD ISM, NIST SP 800-171, PCI DSS, and the Zero Trust Security Executive Order 14028.\n\nThe course concludes with an exploration of cybersecurity capability maturity models, such as C2M2 and the Essential Eight Maturity Model. We'll also discuss career paths, certifications, ethical principles, and professional development opportunities in the rapidly evolving field of cyber security.\n\nBy the end of this course, you'll be equipped to:\n\n- Understand and apply key cyber security standards and frameworks\n- Assess and manage organizational cyber risks effectively\n- Implement robust information security management systems\n- Navigate sector-specific security requirements\n- Contribute to a culture of cyber resilience in your organization\n\nThis course provides the knowledge and skills you need to succeed.

Significant importance is placed on effective project management and excellent communication strategies between team members, the project manager, and with the client. Students work in close liaison with their client and academic assessor throughout the project and are expected to demonstrate a good understanding of their project.\n\nTo be eligible for this course, students must have registered online with the Griffith Sciences Partnership Office in the trimester prior to enrolment. Please contact wil-gs@griffith.edu.au to register. If your registration is successful, you will be given permission to enrol prior to the start of the trimester.\n\nPre-requisite: Must have completed 160 credit points with at least 20 credit points from the major subjects which define the program.

The theory of computation is the core area of computer science that attempts to achieve deep understanding of computational processes by means of mathematical models, tools, and techniques. It is important for algorithm, compiler and VLSI design, the creation of intelligent systems, and cognitive psychology. This course aims to provide generic skills and concept tools that practitioners use in computer engineering. For instance, grammars studied in this course are useful in dealing with strong searching and pattern matching. Studying this course significantly helps in training generic abilities to think and to solve computational problems. \n\nThe course will cover a selection of topics from the following: \n1. Finite state machines, regular languages \n2. Turing machines and computational complexity \n3. Recursive functions and Lambda calculus \n4. Cellular automata \n5. Quantum computation and its applications \n5. Context free languages 6. Number theory \n7. Information and coding theory \n8.
